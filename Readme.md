## Assumptions and Design Decisions

### 1. Real-Time Updates:

WebSockets are used to provide instant communication between clients.

### 2. Authentication:

Users are identified by unique session IDs; additional authentication can be implemented as needed.

### 3. Daphne Server:

While Djangoâ€™s development server works for basic testing, Daphne is recommended for production.

## How to Test

1. Access the Application:
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

2. Features to Test:
   - Join the chat room and send real-time messages.
   - Observe the online members view updating dynamically as users join/leave.
